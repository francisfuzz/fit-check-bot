# Radio Button Styling Fix

## Overview
This document describes the basic fix applied to radio button styling in the Fit Check Bot project after the initial consolidation of styles in `win98-radio-complete.css`.

## Issue Fixed (May 23, 2025)

### Files Affected
- `/src/components/App.jsx` - Added import for win98-radio-complete.css

### Key Fix

1. **Missing Import**
   - Added the required import for `win98-radio-complete.css` in App.jsx
   - This was the primary issue causing radio buttons to not display correctly

## Implementation Details
- Added import statement: `import '../styles/win98-radio-complete.css';` 
- Maintained original styling from the consolidated radio button CSS file
- No visual design changes were made to maintain the original look and feel

## Note
The fix focuses solely on ensuring the radio button styles are properly loaded without changing their appearance or functionality. All original styling from the consolidated file has been preserved.
