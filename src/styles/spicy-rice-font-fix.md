# Spicy Rice Font Fix - May 27, 2025

## Issue
The message boxes were displaying with Spicy Rice font instead of MS Sans Serif font, despite having direct font declarations in the message box CSS.

## Root Cause
The global `body` element had a font-family stack that began with 'Spicy Rice', which was being inherited by message box elements in some cases, overriding their specific font settings.

## Changes Made

1. Updated body font-family in App.css:
   ```css
   /* From */
   font-family: 'Spicy Rice', cursive, 'MS Sans Serif', 'Segoe UI', Arial, sans-serif;
   
   /* To */
   font-family: 'MS Sans Serif', 'Segoe UI', Arial, sans-serif;
   ```

2. Updated body font-family in App-standardized.css:
   ```css
   /* From */
   font-family: 'Spicy Rice', cursive, 'MS Sans Serif', 'Segoe UI', Arial, sans-serif;
   
   /* To */
   font-family: 'MS Sans Serif', 'Segoe UI', Arial, sans-serif;
   ```

## Rationale
While we previously fixed the message box styles to explicitly use MS Sans Serif font, the global body styles were affecting the inheritance hierarchy. By removing Spicy Rice from the body font stack, we ensure that message boxes and other Windows 98-style elements use the correct MS Sans Serif font by default.

The Spicy Rice font import is still maintained for components that specifically need it, but it's no longer the default font for the entire application.

## Verification
The changes have been verified to ensure message boxes now consistently display with MS Sans Serif font, maintaining the authentic Windows 98 look and feel.
