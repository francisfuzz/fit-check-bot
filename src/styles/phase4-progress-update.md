# CSS Consolidation Phase 4 Progress Update - May 23, 2025

## Overview

We've made significant progress on Phase 4 of the CSS consolidation project. This phase focuses on final cleanup, optimization, and documentation to ensure the long-term maintainability of our CSS architecture.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Progress Bar Consolidation
✅ Created `win98-progress-standardized.css` to consolidate all progress bar implementations
✅ Standardized progress bar styling with consistent tokens
✅ Added variations and states for different use cases
✅ Documented progress bar usage in component style guide

### 2. Documentation
✅ Created comprehensive component style guide (`component-style-guide.md`)
✅ Created visual effects & animation guide (`visual-effects-guide.md`)
✅ Documented the CSS consolidation process and results
✅ Created file replacement plan and optimization report

### 3. CSS Organization
✅ Created `main-styles.css` as a central import file
✅ Organized imports in logical order for proper cascading
✅ Separated concerns between design tokens, components, and layout
✅ Prepared for legacy file replacement

### 4. Optimization Planning
✅ Created cleanup & optimization report
✅ Identified duplicate styles, overspecific selectors, and unused code
✅ Documented approach for selector optimization
✅ Created plan for dead code removal

## In-Progress Tasks

### 1. File Replacement
- Replace `win98-windows-complete.css` with `win98-windows-standardized.css`
- Replace `win98-buttons-complete.css` with `win98-buttons-standardized.css`
- Replace `win98-progress.css` with `win98-progress-standardized.css`
- Ensure smooth transition with no styling regressions

### 2. Component Refactoring
- Update component JSX to use standardized class names
- Ensure all components follow the documented patterns
- Test components with new styling

## Pending Tasks

### 1. Cleanup of App.css
- Remove duplicate progress bar styles
- Remove duplicate theme variable definitions
- Move any remaining component styles to appropriate files

### 2. Selector Optimization
